export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

Nowadays we are tasked with building highly performant, highly responsive web applications. We rely on SSR to insure a fast 1st page load and good SEO for our apps, however one problem can sneak in when you implement your responsive components.

Let's first build a really simple [next](https://nextjs.org) responsive app to discover the challenges that lie ahead. We can run `npx create-next-app .` to generate a bare-bones SSR application. We can strip out most of the stuff in `pages/index.js` and leave it like this:

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

<Image src={img1} />

We can now add some components to simulate different mobile and desktop designs

```html
<main>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

  <h2>Mobile Design</h2>
  <h2>Desktop Design</h2>
</main>
```

<Image src={img2} />

Our goal is to conditionally show these `h2` tags. There are multiple approaches for this:

## #1 Just some good old CSS!

We can simply just use css [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to selectively show and hide these elements. We can use the [css modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) files shipped with the default next app to add some classes that achieves our goal.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .desktop {
    display: none;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 769px) {
  .mobile {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

```html
<main>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

  <h2 className="mobile">Mobile Design</h2>
  <h2 className="desktop">Desktop Design</h2>
</main>
```

And if we run this, it indeed works! It switches the elements precisely at `768px`.

<video autoPlay loop muted playsInline src={img3} />

While this approach is simple and works natively, it has one simple issue. If we peek at the code sent by our server (we can do that from the network tab in our devtools, filter by `Doc` for clarity, and then click preview to get a look at the raw `html` sent), we find it clearly:

<Image src={img4} />

The server sends both components, and this makes sense. The React code includes both components so they will both be sent, accompanied with the css that will be evaluated by the browser and decides which one to show. Of course in this trivial example it's not an issue. But for complex web apps, where large expensive component trees will be sent over the wire and hydrated on the client, it can get quiet excessive!

If you accept this performance compromise, then this solution is perfect! Sure, it will be cumbersome to control everything with media queries and it will get annoying repeating the same component twice with different props and attaching a media query to show only one. So, we can do better!

## #2 Throw JS at the issue _(Using the [window.matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) api)_

Trust me, I want to avoid solving every problem I face with JS like you also, but hear me out. This api allows us to get a reactive value for a media query, and we can then consume it normally in our react code. We can write a simple react hook to set it up and use it in our page, but I prefer to use an external one since they handle a lot of edge cases (oh there is so many) which we will discuss below.

I am familiar with [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)'s [hook](https://mantine.dev/hooks/use-media-query/) `useMediaQuery`. But there is a lot of other options we can choose from. We can then define a new custom hook to detect whether this is a mobile view or not and consume it everywhere in our project.

```jsx
import { useMediaQuery } from '@mantine/hooks'

export const useIsMobile = () => {
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)')

  return {
    isMobile,
  }
}
```

```jsx
{
  isMobile ? <h2>Mobile Design</h2> : <h2>Desktop Design</h2>
}
```

<video autoPlay loop muted playsInline src={img5} />

As we can see it works just as before, but we solved the previous issue! Only one component was sent over the wire. However, as you can see, the desktop component was the one that was sent, not the mobile. Why do you think that happened? This will cause a nasty effect where the UI will load the desktop version at first until the DOM rehydrates, then it will show the correct component.

<video autoPlay loop muted playsInline src={img6} />

I changed the styling of the desktop design to make it more noticeable. Even in this super trivial example, it is a little bit distracting. For large scale apps, like the one we are working on right now, it becomes super annoying and provides a really bad UX.

If we took a look at Mantine's [source code](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/master/src/mantine-hooks/src/use-media-query/use-media-query.ts). Other than handling weird Safari bugs and providing important React plumbing for the hook to work smoothly, it handles a very important thing which is the core of our issue.

What will the function return in the server, where it does not have access to the `window` object? The answer is that sadly we will never be able to know the screen width on the server. So simply, the function just accepts a second attribute `initialValue` that it will return if `typeof window === "undefined"` (essentially means we are running server side code right now).

So what do we choose for `initialValue`? For us, we just simply chose based on whether the majority of our users are mobile or not. Turns out that **95%** of our users where on mobile, so we just simply turned `initialValue` to `true`.

<Image src={img7} />

So there... we solved the issue for the vast majority of our users and shipped small documents as a bonus, pretty cool right? **No.** We can do better.

## #3 Provide a better initial value

I kept thinking about ways I can detect the screen width while I was in the server, until it dawned on me! For our purposes, we only need to know if its a mobile or not. We have a way of knowing this with a reasonable degree of accuracy, [User Agents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent)!

A user agent is just a string the browser sends in the header so the server knows some info about the client. If you take a look at your user agent (`window.navigator.userAgent` in your console) you will find it super confusing, and amusingly it includes the names of almost all browsers in it! Super useful of course!! This is mine right now on Chrome as an example: `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/108.0.0.0 Safari/537.36` It is worth reading about the [history](https://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/) of user agents, but it is not our topic today.

What I thought about, is we can make a reasonably guess for the user device based on their user agent, and then we can pass this value to `useMediaQuery` as the `initialValue`. We can then define a function to detect the user's device with the help of the amazing [UAParser](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js) lib.

```js
import UAParser from 'ua-parser-js'

export const isMobileDevice = (context) => {
  const useragent = context.req?.headers['user-agent']
  const parser = new UAParser(useragent)
  const device = parser.getDevice()
  return device.type === 'mobile'
}
```

`context` here is the Next object that gets passed in it's server side functions. Make sure to import this function only in server side next code, so that `ua-parser-js` does not get into your client bundle. Then we can consume it in our page and pass it to our hook.

```js
import { useIsMobile } from '../hooks/useIsMobile'
import { isMobileDevice } from '../lib/detectMobile'

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const userDevice = isMobileDevice(context)
  return {
    props: {
      userDevice,
    },
  }
}

export default function Home({ userDevice }) {
  const { isMobile } = useIsMobile(userDevice)
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

      {isMobile ? <h2>Mobile Design</h2> : <h2>Desktop Design</h2>}
    </main>
  )
}
```

```jsx
import { useMediaQuery } from '@mantine/hooks'

export const useIsMobile = (userDevice) => {
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)', userDevice)

  return {
    isMobile,
  }
}
```

And thats it! We now covered more than **99.9%** of our users (looking at you iPad Pro users), and shipped minimal markup. Our code is very clean and functional. I call that a win!

## Closing Thoughts

There is some more complicated solutions I did not cover here, like: [@artsy/fresnel](https://github.com/artsy/fresnel). Be ware it is not compatible with React 18.

I think the use case of combining a `window.matchMedia` JS approach accompanied with providing an initial value based on the user agent provides a super robust way to rended a modern responsive SSR app.
